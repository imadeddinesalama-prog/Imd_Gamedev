SCAMPER of Skyrim

S >> Substitute
Substitute traditional weapons with elemental powers or skills (magic-first combat instead of sword-focused builds)

C >> Combine
Combine open-world exploration + narrative quests + character progression into a single continuous experience with no level walls

A >> Adapt
Adapt the dragon threat into roaming world bosses that dynamically change regions and encounters

M >> Modify
Modify large regions into themed zones with stronger identity (snow, fire, ruins), each with unique mechanics

P >> Put to another use
Use shouts not just for combat, but for puzzles, traversal, and social interactions

E >> Eliminate
Eliminate quest clutter and excessive item management; focus on meaningful choices and skills

R >> Reverse
Reverse the power fantasy: instead of being the chosen hero early, the world treats you as fragile until you earn recognition

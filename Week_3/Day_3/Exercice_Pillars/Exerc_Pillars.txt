3 Core Pillars : 

- Restoration – bringing life, water, and color back to a dead world

- Tension – surviving in hostile fire-controlled zones with limited resources

- Discovery – uncovering new abilities, paths, and hidden lore through exploration


No grinding progression comes from exploration and meaningful encounters, not repeating the same fights.

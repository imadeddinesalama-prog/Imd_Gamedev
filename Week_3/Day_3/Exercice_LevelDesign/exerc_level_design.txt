Room 1 — Entry / Teaching Room

Purpose: Teach the core mechanic (fire drains water energy).
Design: Small safe space, one weak fire enemy, visible water pool.
Checkpoint: At room entrance
Why: Saves time after death and lets beginners retry without pressure.

Room 2 — Hazard Test Room

Purpose: Test water management and movement.
Design: Fire jets on the floor, short gaps, limited water pickups.
Checkpoint:  None
Why: Short room; failure is quick and learning-focused.

Room 3 — Combat Pressure Room

Purpose: Combine combat + hazards.
Design: Multiple enemies, spreading fire zones, one refill node.
Checkpoint:  After clearing the room
Why: Reduces frustration before the hardest encounter.

Room 4 — Boss Room (Twist & Mastery)

Purpose: Twist the mechanic and demand mastery.
Design: Fire guardian that evaporates water, forcing smart ability use.
Checkpoint: Right before the boss
Why: Prevents replaying earlier rooms and respects player time.

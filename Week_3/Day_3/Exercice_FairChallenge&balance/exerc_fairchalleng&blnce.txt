Adaptive Water Refill
If the player fails multiple times in the same area, nearby water droplets spawn more often.

How it helps beginners:
It reduces frustration without removing challenge, letting new players recover and learn instead of getting stuck.


Tuning Knobs

1- Water Drain Rate
Lower drain = calmer exploration; higher drain = more tension and urgency.

2- Enemy Fire Damage
Lower damage helps beginners survive longer; higher damage rewards mastery and careful play.

If you want, I can next:

- Define difficulty modes using knobs

- Create a beginner-friendly onboarding flow

- Turn this into a pitch-ready slide

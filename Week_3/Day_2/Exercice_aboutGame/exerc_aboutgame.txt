Player controls a water slime → explores and restores → a world burned by the Fire Nation

Goal:
Restore water sources and weaken Fire Nation control across the world.

Rules:

   - Water energy slowly drains in fire areas and must be replenished at water nodes.

   - Skills are unlocked only by defeating area bosses and collecting skill shards.

Feedback:
When restoring a water source, the world shifts from red to blue with a calm flowing-water sound.


Rule Change & Experience Impact : 

Changed Rule: Water energy no longer drains over time, only when using skills.
Impact: Exploration becomes calmer and more strategic, shifting tension from survival to skill management and planning.

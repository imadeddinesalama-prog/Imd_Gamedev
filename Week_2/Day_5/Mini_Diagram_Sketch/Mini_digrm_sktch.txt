In a standard Action-RPG health system, the stock is the player's current Hit Point (HP) pool, which represents their remaining vitality. The source includes restorative elements like health potions, healing spells, or passive regeneration that replenish the pool. Conversely, the sink consists of damage taken from enemy attacks, environmental hazards, or status effects like poison, which deplete the HP stock until it reaches zero.
